 Sentiment analysis virtual bot is an automated system that uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to analyze and understand human emotions and opinions. The system can analyze text from data from social media, customer feedback, reviews and other sources to identify the sentiment of the text, whether positive, negative or neutral. The sentiment analysis virtual bot can provide real-time feedback and insights to businesses and organizations, allowing them to better understand customer need and preferences. The technology behind virtual bot is continuously evolving with new techniques being developed to improve accuracy and performance. These virtual bots are AI-powered tools that have gained significant popularity in recent years. They are designed to analyze and interpret human emotions and sentiments in written or spoken text, allowing them to understand the mood or tone of a conversation or text message. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, sentiment analysis virtual bots can accurately identify emotions and respond accordingly. Overall, these bots offer an efficient and cost-effective way for businesses and even social media platforms to manage customer experience. With the increasing adoption of AI and machine learning technologies, sentiment analysis virtual bots are poised to play a more significant role in the future of customer service and marketing.

 In this project, we try to implement an NLP Twitter sentiment analysis model that helps to overcome the challenges of sentiment classification of tweets. We will be classifying the tweets into positive or negative sentiments. The necessary details regarding the dataset involving the Twitter sentiment analysis project are:
 
The dataset provided is the Sentiment140 Dataset which consists of 1,600,000 tweets that have been extracted using the Twitter API. The various columns present in this Twitter data are:
target: the polarity of the tweet (positive or negative)
- ids: Unique id of the tweet
- date: the date of the tweet
- flag: It refers to the query. If no such query exists, then it is NO QUERY.
- user: It refers to the name of the user that tweeted
- text: It refers to the text of the tweet
